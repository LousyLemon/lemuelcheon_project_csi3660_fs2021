	<h2>Project Summary</h2>        
	<p>
		The purpose of this project was to create a working File Server using Apache
 	and hosting the server within the GCP.<br> The students would use the concepts
 	learned from the course to create the framework for file transfer between user and server.

	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>This project requires fundamental knowledge of Linux (CentOS) and webpage creation.</p>
	<ul>
    	    <li>Basic commands: copy(cp), move(move), make directory(mkdir), create file(touch),<br>
		install, and all the other basics allow for application and utilization of the OS.
	    <li>Linux file system: user permissions, groups, file ownership, config<br>
		 files, as these things create the framework for a functioning file server.
	    <li>HTML: is used for webpage creation, design, and implementation of server scripts<br>
		 which allow file transfer.
	</ul>

		<h3>Project Overview</h3>
		<h4>What is the service?</h4>
		<p>The Apache File Server is a barebones file transfer service, in which users can upload<br>
	  		files to the GCP VM (within the file size limit [~2M]) via their web browser. Offering<br>
	   		easy access and usability. Similar to DropBox, or any other hosted storage system. 
		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the service</h4>
		<p>
	  		Uploading a file to the server is as simple as clicking on 'Choose File',<br>
	   	selecting a single file you want to upload, then click 'Upload'.<br>
	   	The server will then show the target directory the file has been uploaded<br>
	   	to on the GCP, and whether there were any errors.
